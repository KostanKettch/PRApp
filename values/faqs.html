		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<a name="q328326c"></a><strong>Can I play my music/downloads/audio books using this app?</strong><br />
		Sure, you can play your music/downloads/audio books using this app. To do that you need to setup a &#8220;virtual&#8221; podcast. It will use a directory on the local device as a &#8220;virtual&#8221; podcast repository. All media files in the directory will be imported into the database and treated as episodes of this &#8220;virtual&#8221; podcast.
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<a name="q329326c"></a><strong>How to add a podcast feed manually?</strong><br />
		If your podcast is not found by searching, you can always add the podcast manually. Please go to the Podcasts tab and tap the Add button on the title bar. Then select <strong>Add podcast by URL</strong> from the menu. Enter your podcast feed and then hit the find podcast button. If the podcast is found, it will be added to the app.
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<a name="q160214b"></a><strong>What do the blue and green progress circles mean?</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The blue progress circle is the playback progress indicator.</li>
			<li>The green progress circle is the download progress indicator.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<a name="q160712c"></a><strong>What are the blue and green numbers displayed in the Podcasts tab?</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The blue number is the total unplayed episode count.</li>
			<li>The green number is the number of the recent episodes retrieved since the last time you have opened the podcast.<br />
				This number will be reset to zero once you open the podcast to view its episode list.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<a name="q123456a"></a><strong>How to set up to check for new episodes automatically?</strong><br />
		By default this app will check for podcast update every three hours. If you want to set up a different update checking interval or disable the auto checking completely, you can do that through the <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Swipe to right from the left edge of the screen to open the <a href="#q171209a">side navigation menu</a></li>
		<li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> to open the app settings screen</li>
		<li>Go to the <strong>Podcasts</strong> settings</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Update podcasts</strong> setting and select an option from the list</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q971945c"></a><strong>Why my podcast doesn&#8217;t get updated?</strong><br />
	You know there are new episodes being published but this app doesn&#8217;t get those new episodes. Well, this 
	is very likely that there&#8217;s a publishing date typo/error in the podcast&#8217;s
	RSS feed. This app uses the publishing date of each episode as the key indicator of whether
	it is a new episode to be retrieved or an old episode to be discarded. Sometimes,
	however, the publishing date of some episodes will be wrong because of typo or whatever
	reasons. If that wrong publishing date is months later than current date, it will
	prevent this app from updating the podcast, as all episodes before that wrong date will be
	discarded as false &#8220;older&#8221; episode. In this case, the quickest way to make this app
	to update the podcast again is to <a href="#q1605021">reset the episode data</a>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q190325b"></a><strong>What are the chapters?</strong><br />
	<strong>Chapters</strong> or bookmarks as called by some other apps are notes to specific points in the timeline of an audio or video file. They are especially useful for lengthy episode. You can click on the chapter to start playing from that specific position in the timeline.
	<p>Some podcast publishers may add the chapters info into the podcast media file. In that case, this app will extract them and display them to you. This app can also take the chapters info in the podcast show notes if that's detected. Users can also add chapters manually.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q935117a"></a><strong>How to access the individual podcast settings?</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Go to the Podcasts tab</li>
		<li>Tap the podcast name to open the podcast</li>
		<li>Click the Settings button on the screen to open the individual podcast settings</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q010311d"></a><strong>What is Episode unique criteria?</strong><br />
	Episode unique criteria is the criteria used to identify an episode uniquely. This episode unique criteria is used to prevent duplicated episodes fetched from the podcast feed. Many podcast publishers assign a global unique ID (GUID) to an episode to identify each episode uniquely. However, that&#8217;s not required by the podcast feed RSS standard. Some podcast publishers don&#8217;t use GUID at all. Instead they use episode url or episode publishing date or episode title as an unique way to identify an episode.
	<p>By default, this app will try to detect the unique criteria used in the podcast feed and remove the duplicated episodes from the podcast feed. It should work fine most of the time. In case the auto detected unique criteria doesn&#8217;t work and duplicated episodes do happen, you can go to the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a> to set this episode unique criteria manually.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q1605021"></a><strong>What does Reset episodes do?</strong><br />
	Episode data will be cached locally by this app in the app database when they are retrieved from the podcast server. Reset episodes will discard the episode data cached in the database and rebuild from the podcast server again. This is useful in case the cached episode data get corrupted due to<br />
	various reasons or have errors in the episode data.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q323226a"></a><strong>How does the auto download work?</strong><br />
	The auto download option can be turned on from either in <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a> page or fine tuned for each podcast in the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a>. Once turned on, the auto download service will run in the background and automatically download <b>most recent</b> <b>episodes</b> it finds for you periodically.
	<p>Most recent <b>episodes</b> are the new episodes since the podcast was viewed last time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Notice: If your device is rebooted, you need to start this app first to get the auto download service started again.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<a name="q323233a"></a><strong>Can I turn on/off the auto download for certain podcasts?</strong><br />
	Yes, the auto download feature can be fine tuned for each podcast through the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a>. The <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a> will override the system&#8217;s settings.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<a name="q180517a"></a><strong>What is Smart download?</strong><br />
	With <strong>Smart download</strong> enabled, this app will automatically download up to x number of newer and unplayed episodes from the current playing podcast whenever you start playing an episode. This feature is very useful if you have a large backlog or if you like to play
	the episodes in the chronological order. When you start playing an episode from date X, the app will start downloading the newer episodes (X+1, X+2...) in the background so you can continue to play those newer episodes offline when current episode X finishes!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q553233a"></a><strong>What is Keep download?</strong><br />
For <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a>, this is the max number of download will be kept for each podcast. If new episode is added to the download list and it exceeds this cap, the oldest downloaded file will be deleted automatically.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q663233a"></a><strong>How to save downloads to SD card?</strong><br />
Please go to the <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a> and set the download location to use SD card under <strong>Downloads</strong> settings.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q663777a"></a><strong>Why the download is paused for Wi-Fi?</strong><br />
By default, this app will download with Wi-Fi connection only. If Wi-Fi is not available, the download will pause and resume when the Wi-Fi is available.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q190325c"></a><strong>Why the download is paused for battery low while it's plugged for charging?</strong><br />
Android system will send out battery <strong>LOW</strong> warning if the battery level goes below 15%. However, Android system will not send out battery <strong>OK</strong> till the battery level goes above 20% later. 
As a result if the download is paused for battery low it won't be resumed even you have the device plugged in till the Android system reaches battery <strong>OK</strong> state.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q863777a"></a><strong>Can I download over 3G or 4G data connection?</strong><br />
Yes, please turn off Download With Wi-Fi only in <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q160802b"></a><strong>What does the download failed message mean?</strong><br />
<ul>
	<li>URL could not be found: <em>The podcast to be downloaded is not available on the server. Most likely the podcast has been removed by the podcast publisher or it is not accessible from your Internet connection.</em></li>
	<li>Insufficient space: <em>Not enough free space available in your storage.</em></li>
	<li>Failed: <em>Unknown error has happened during the downloading.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q993777a"></a><strong>Can I resume a failed download?</strong><br />
Yes, long press the failed download item in the downloads screen will bring up a menu, select Redownload from the menu will download the item again.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q910777a"></a><strong>How to remove the download automatically after being played?</strong><br />
<ol>
	<li>Open <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a></li>
	<li>Go under <strong>Downloads</strong> settings</li>
	<li>Turn on <strong>Delete the download</strong> when an episode is 100% played</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q1605022"></a><strong>How can I save a podcast permanently?</strong><br />
If you like to keep a copy of a podcast permanently, please download the podcast first and then export the downloaded podcast to a folder on your device. The exported podcast file will be saved to use its podcast title as the file name. The export podcast feature can be accessed in various screens. Long press the items in the <strong>Downloads</strong> tab or <a href="#q170909a">overflow menu</a> in the <strong>Playing</strong> screen.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q910117a"></a><strong>Why do I get duplicated downloads?</strong><br />
This app uses a complicated algorithm to detect the episode unique criteria used in the podcast feed to remove duplicated episodes. However, this auto detection may fail sometimes, which results in duplicated episodes are retrieved as new episodes and get downloaded. In the case the auto detecting of episode unique criteria fails, it is recommended to set this criteria in the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a> manually.
<p>Read more on <a href="#q010311d">What is Episode unique criteria?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q931117a"></a><strong>Is there any way to know whether an episode has been downloaded?</strong><br />
Once the download is completed the download button will change to a check mark to indicate the download has been completed.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q181016a"></a><strong>How to move the download directory to a new location?</strong><br />
Open <a href="#q173402b">app settings</a> and go into Downloads settings. Click on the <strong>Download location</strong> setting to select a new directory. The app will then move existing downloads from current download directory to the selected directory automatically. No need to move the downloads manually. Please make sure you have enough space to put all existing download files in the new location.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q927326c"></a><strong>Why my audio podcast is played as video?</strong><br />
On some devices the podcast media format may not be detected correctly. In that case please go to the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a> and set the media type manually.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q347326c"></a><strong>Can I play a video podcast as audio only?</strong><br />
Please go to the <a href="#q935117a">individual podcast settings</a> and set the media type to be Audio, that will force the app to play the video podcast as audio only.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q1605023"></a><strong>Why does the playback stop after certain (x) minutes in the background?</strong><br />
This typically happens if you have the battery saving or optimization enabled in your Android settings. Please try disabling the battery saving or excluding this app from the optimization in your Android settings. There are also some third party apps such as task/memory managing apps or anti-virus apps which can kill running apps in background. If you have those apps installed, please try adding this app to the whitelist so it won&#8217;t be killed by those apps.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q181022a"></a><strong>The podcast volume is too low. Can I boost the audio output?</strong><br />
Yes, audio boosting is supported in the app to boost the audio output. Please pull up the mini player at the bottom of the screen to expand it to a full screen player and then press the more button (three dots icon) to open the playback menu. Then select Audio effects & equalizer option 
from the menu. You can enable the audio boost either for one podcast or all podcasts.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q181023a"></a><strong>Does the app have a sleep timer to stop playing after X time?</strong><br />
Yes, sleep timer is supported in the app. Please pull up the mini player at the bottom of the screen to expand it to a full screen player. The sleep timer is located on playback controls row.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
<a name="q181024a"></a><strong>Can I schedule a time to play a podcast?</strong><br />
Yes, you can use the alarm feature in this app to schedule a time to play selected podcast, radio station, or a playlist automatically.
<p>&nbsp;</p>	

<a name="q161022a"></a><strong>How to cast to Chromecast?</strong><br />
Chromecast is supported in this app. The Chromecast icon will show up on the upper right corner of the <strong>Playing</strong> screen when any Chromecase device is detected.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q190325a"></a><strong>What is Smart rewind?</strong><br />
Smart rewind is a feature in this app which will rewind from 5 seconds to 60 seconds automatically depends on how long the playback has been paused or stopped. The longer the playback was paused or stopped the longer rewind time will be applied.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q210810a"></a><strong>How to disable Bluetooth automatic playback?</strong><br />
Some Bluetooth speakers or car kits will sends a <strong>Play</strong>  command automatically upon connected to your Android. Android will then start the most recently played app regardless whether the app is running or not. In order to stop this automatic playback in this app, please go to 
<strong>app Settings</strong> > <strong>Media Player</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> to turn on the option <strong>Bluetooth auto play workaround</strong>. 
<p>With this <strong>Bluetooth auto play workaround</strong> option enabled, this app won't respond to the Play command if the following conditions are satisfied: 
<ul>
	<li>The app is in background or screen is locked or turned off.</li>
	<li>The app is not currently playing or in Paused playback state</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q210817a"></a><strong>Why do multiple playback notifications stack up on Android 11?</strong><br />
Android 11 has a new media control which groups all media notifications into Quick settings. By default this new media control shows up all the time regardless whether the podcast is playing or not.
<p>Unfortunately, this new media control was very buggy when Android 11 was released. Multiple media notifications may stack up on the notification tray.</p>
<p>Google has fixed this bug in one of the system patches. However, only a few devices such as Google Pixel phones have received the system patch.</p>
<p>If your device manufacture hasn't pushed this system patch to you yet you can workaround the bug by going to <strong>app Settings > Notifications</strong> to turn on <strong>Use legacy media notification</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q1605024"></a><strong>What are the play modes?</strong><br />
Currently there are seven playback modes supported in this app:
<ul>
	<li>Shuffle mode: plays all episodes in the same playlist or episode list but in a random order</li>
	<li>Priority mode: finish current episode and then switch to play the highest (non-empty) priority playlist</li>

	<li>Repeat episode: play the same episode repeatedly till it is stopped by user</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently selected play mode will be displayed on top of the <strong>Up Next</strong> list in the <strong>Playing</strong> screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q161021d"></a><strong>Why does it start playing next episode automatically?</strong><br />

Now, the <strong>Up Next</strong> list will be populated with all episodes from the <strong>Downloads</strong> list. Also, when the episode ordering is changed in the playlist, that change will be synced to the <strong>Up Next</strong> list automatically. You don&#8217;t need to do anything manually to update the play queue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="q177642e"></a><strong>How does the playlist work?</strong><br />
In this app any episode list can be played as a playlist. You can click the episode in the episode list to start playing. The episode list will then be populated to the <strong>Up Next</strong> list.

</ul>
A <strong>priority</strong> value can be assigned to a playlist. When playing with <strong>Priority</strong> mode, after current episode finishes the player will automatically switch to play the highest (non-empty) priority playlist.

	<a name="q201223a"></a><strong>How does this app access the storage?</strong><br />
	Android 4.4 introduces the <b>Storage Access Framework</b> (SAF) to secure user’s files. SAF allows users to grant the access permission to a single file or directory dynamically instead of granting the storage permission to the whole storage blankly during the app installation. 
	This provides better privacy protection for users. User privacy is the #1 consideration of this app. Therefore, this app uses SAF when dealing with your storage. 
	
	<p>Any time this app needs to access a file or directory it will redirect your to Android's built-in file manager app to complete the select the file or directory. Android system will then grant the access permission to the selected file or directory to this app. If you use a third party file manager app then
	this procedure may break depends on how well your file manager app supports SAF. We strongly suggest to use Android's built-in file manager app to avoid any issues when dealing with your storage.</p>
	
	<a name="q201223b"></a><strong>Why podcast info isn't displayed via Bluetooth in my car?</strong><br />
	Typically that's due to the incompatible <b>AVRCP</b> versions on your phone and your car Bluetooth. To fix that, first, you'll need to have <b>Developer options</b> enabled in your <b>Android Settings</b>. 
	Open your <b>Android Settings</b> and then go to <b>About Phone</b>, then tap the <b>Build Number</b> 7 times. After <b>Developer options</b> is enabled, go into <b>Developer Options</b>, 
	scroll down to <b>Bluetooth AVRCP Version</b>. Change <b>AVRCP</b> version to a lower version, restart the phone. You may need to try couple times to find the right <b>AVRCP</b> version which is compatible with your car.
